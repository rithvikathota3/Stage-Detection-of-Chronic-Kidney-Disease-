1. Importing the packages
2. exploring the dataset - chronic kidney disease prediction
3. Data Processing
	- Data droping if any null values 
4. Visualization Data using Seaborn and Matplotlib for few columns
5. Data Cleaning 
	- Label Encoding for string to int or float
6. Feature Selection 
7. Splitting the data into train and test
6. building the model

	- Random Forest
	- Decision Tree
	- KNN
	- Support Vector Machine
	- Voting Classifier
	- AdaBoost
	- XGBoost
	- CNN+LSTM
	- CNN

6.training the model
7.building the model Voitng Classifier becoz comparing to other models Voting Classifier 
	gives better accuracy
8. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
9. User gives input
10. the given input preprocessed and with trained model is used for predicting the performance 
11. final outcome is displayed

Note:
Extension - The extension model is voting classifier gaves better accyracy around 96% of Accuracy
